This repository contains two *really* different language Versions, and a few newer or older ones of each.
* ccl - the old language Version. Many modern features are missing.
* coa - the new language Version. Modern features implemented.

So, if you already have a project using CoaLang, you may want to use the old versions. But if you are starting something new, you should
use the most recent version - when I am writing this, it is `coa0.5.8.2.jar`.
